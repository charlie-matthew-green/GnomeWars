Welcome to GnomeWars!

To play run 'Run Me\GnomeWars.exe' from the command line passing in the filepath of the map, the number of types of gnome, and the number of gnomes of each type.

For example, on Windows (from the 'Run Me' folder):

GnomeWars.exe Maps\Map1.txt 3 4

which uses the map at Maps\Map1.txt and has 3 groups of 4 gnomes
